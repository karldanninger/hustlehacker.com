        <h4>Manifesto</h4>
        Being a Hustle Hacker is letting yourself explore ideas.
        We are not scared to fail.
        We maintain a Hustlers state of mind.
        We build, iterate and learn quickly.
        We stay excited, and help others do the same.
        We are creators, and we are motivated.
        We want to share this manifesto.

        During our adventures to events, conferences & workshops,
        we catalogued our experiences. We maintained a twitter account,
        blogged, and photographed many tech oriented events that happened
        downtown Toronto.
